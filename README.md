#Share Keep

Vision: put in a link to media, get a link that will never die to share / keep ðŸ˜Ž

Media requested through the link given to users will be directed to the source if it exists (most usecases), otherwise will provide from the backup, We will make download an option to avoid streaming as much as possible.
UI development will not be stopped until it is impeccable, MERN stack, with rarely accessed files possibly stored elsewhere.

Media types I'm thinking for MVP
  video, images
if ðŸ’² happens:
  articles, google results diff, chrome extension that let's you select a portion of your screen, hopefully finding the intended source,
  Let people sign in and have a list of all the things they've saved and shared, from every source.
  
people will be inclined to use a forward focused solution if it is not inconvenient, make 4k+ 1 dollar a month.
