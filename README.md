#Share Keep

Vision: put in a link to media, get a link that will never die to share

Most media that will be shared will already be stored

if the origin of the media is still available when the link is accessed it will pass through from there, not from our storage

at the time that the link is put through the system, the origin will contain the media, and will for some time after

people will be inclined to use a forward focused solution if it is not inconvenient

npm install
npm start
